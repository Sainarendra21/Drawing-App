# Simple Drawing App

Welcome to the Simple Drawing App! This is a basic web-based drawing application that allows you to create simple sketches using your mouse. It's a great way to explore your creativity and have some fun with digital art.

## Features

- Crosshair cursor for precise drawing.
- Clear canvas button to start over.
- Real-time drawing feedback.
- 
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Use your mouse to draw on the canvas.
4. Adjust line thickness by modifying the `context.lineWidth` value in the `script.js` file.
5. Click the "Clear Canvas" button to reset the canvas.

## Customization

You can easily customize the app by tweaking the `styles.css` file to change the appearance of the canvas and buttons. Additionally, you can modify the behavior of the drawing app by editing the `script.js` file. Feel free to experiment and make the app your own!
It looks like you've provided the HTML code for a simple drawing app webpage. This app includes a canvas element where users can draw, a button to clear the canvas, and references to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**: This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.

2. **html**: The root element of the HTML document.

3. **head**: This section contains metadata about the document and includes the title of the webpage and a reference to an external stylesheet (styles.css) for styling.

4. **title**: Sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. **link**: This element establishes a link to an external stylesheet (styles.css) for applying styles to the HTML content.

6. **body**: This is the main content of the webpage.

7. **h1**: This is a level 1 heading that displays the text "Simple Drawing App".

8. **button**: This button element has the id "resetButton". Users can click it to clear the drawing canvas.

9. **canvas**: This is an HTML5 element for drawing graphics. It has the id "drawingCanvas" and will be used to create the drawing area.

10. **script**: This element includes a reference to an external JavaScript file (script.js) which will provide the functionality for the drawing app.

So, this HTML code sets up the basic structure of a webpage for a simple drawing app, including the necessary components for drawing on a canvas and resetting the canvas. The actual drawing functionality and interactivity would be implemented in the linked JavaScript file (script.js), and the styling would be handled by the linked CSS file (styles.css).

This app should work on most modern web browsers. However, for the best experience, we recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

## Acknowledgments

This simple drawing app was created as a learning exercise and is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API for rendering the drawing.
